# ECE 5725 Final Project
Haoyang & Yue

## Baseline Design

This is in essence an information transformation problem, that can be decomposed into the following steps:
1. Sound to Music File: microphone
2. Music File to Spectrum: transform series data into time-frequency spectrums
3. Spectrum to Pitch: detect the correspondence between spectrum and pitch
4. Pitch to Note: detect the correspondence between pitch and note
5. Note to Symbolic Graphs: for simplified notes, text printing should be fine
6. Symbolic Graphs to Printed Format: a mini-printer

## Strech Goals

- Short pitch detection (impulse)
- Harmonic detection
- Real-time detection: input from the microphone and output from the Resparry pi
- Symphony
- Pop music with lyrics
- Staff notations
- Reverse procedure: input staff notations and output the music -> machine learning
